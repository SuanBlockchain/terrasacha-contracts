| **Fundraising** | 6-18 months | 3-6 months | **Faster** (token liquidity) |
| **Time to Project Start** | 2-4 years | 2.5-3.5 years | Comparable |
| **First Revenue** | 5-7 years (after verification) | 2.5 years (grey token sales) | **Much faster** |
| **Investor Liquidity** | None (illiquid until credit issuance) | Immediate (P2P trading) | **Major advantage** |
